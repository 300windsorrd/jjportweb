1) The positioning: what the site should “sell” in 10 seconds

Headline (above the fold):
Engineering Science + Systems Builder who ships real-world programs and products at the intersection of STEM, data, and community impact.

Subheadline (1 sentence):
I build scalable systems—software and people-systems—turning messy real-world workflows into measurable outcomes.

This matches how you’re described publicly (engineering student, data analytics, leadership, advocacy) and your personal brand voice (faith-guided, service, storytelling/design)

2) Site map that actually converts (minimal pages, maximum punch)
A) / Home (conversion page)

Goal: make someone want to click deeper or contact you.

Sections

Hero + Proof bar

3–5 proof chips: “Engineering @ BCC”, “Program Lead”, “Data dashboards”, “Full-stack builds”, “Public speaking/advocacy”

3 Tracks (interactive selector)

Engineering (systems, prototypes, sustainability)

Software/Data (React/Node/TS, dashboards, automation)

Leadership & Speaking (program leadership, workshops, testimony)

Featured case studies (3 cards)

Nexusverium.tech

AI Literacy Instruction

USDA Plant-Forward program building (curriculum + operations)

Call to action

“Book a call” / “Email me” / “Download resume” / “View GitHub”

B) /work Case Studies (the most important page)

This is where offers are won.
Every project becomes a case study template (more below).

Include filters: Engineering / Software / Data / Leadership / Speaking.

C) /timeline Impact Timeline (signature “wow” component)

A scroll-driven timeline with “chapters,” each with artifacts:

Programs you led, dashboards shipped, talks delivered, websites deployed, collaborations.
This should highlight that you build systems + communities, not just code.

Use USDA details as “Program Systems” credibility: mentorship roles, safety/logistics, curriculum structure 

USDA Program Book

.

D) /speaking Public Speaking & Leadership

Show:

Talks, workshops, facilitation, testimony/advocacy
BCC spotlight explicitly mentions your advocacy/testimony and leadership roles .

E) /about Story (short, modern, confident)

Use your narrative: Dominican Republic → Bronx Science STEM rigor → NJ → engineering + storytelling + service 

Jensy Jimenez Portfolio

.
Keep faith references present but tasteful: “Guided by faith; focused on service and integrity.”

F) /contact (simple)

Fast form + scheduling link + direct email.

3) Case study template (non-negotiable if you want interviews)

Every project page should follow this structure:

One-line outcome (metrics if possible)

Problem (who had pain, what broke)

Constraints (time, budget, stakeholders, tech limits)

Approach (system design + decisions)

Implementation (architecture diagram, key modules)

Results (numbers, screenshots, before/after)

What I’d improve next (shows maturity)

Artifacts (repo links, live demo, slides, PDF, photos)

Apply it to your required projects

Nexusverium.tech

Position as: “Environmental engineering + AI-enabled monitoring / remediation concept” (or whatever the current scope is)

Add: interactive system diagram + prototype screenshots + roadmap.

AI Literacy Instruction

Position as: “Curriculum + delivery system”

Include modules, learning outcomes, sample materials, and a short demo video.

USDA Plant-Forward / program building

This is a killer leadership case study because it proves you can design a real program end-to-end: schedule blocks, weekly modules, logistics, mentorship model 

USDA Program Book

 

USDA Program Book

Also: it explicitly lists you as Lead Student Coordinator

 — that’s serious operational leadership.

4) “Beautiful AI components” that don’t look gimmicky

These should feel useful, not like toys.

1) AI Portfolio Concierge (RAG Chat)

A chat widget trained only on:

your case studies (markdown)

your resume PDF

select artifacts (program book excerpts, slide decks)

public “About” info

It answers recruiter questions like:

“What did Jensy do on the USDA program?”

“Show me projects that prove TypeScript + data skills.”

“Summarize Jensy’s leadership experience.”

2) Skill Evidence Graph

Interactive graph: Skill → Projects → Artifacts
Click “TypeScript” → shows projects + code snippets + links.
Click “Leadership” → shows USDA mentorship systems + coordinator role 

USDA Program Book

.

3) Timeline with “Impact Modes”

Toggle:

“Engineering mode” (systems/prototypes)

“Software mode” (apps/automation)

“Leadership mode” (programs/events/public speaking)

4) Auto-generated one-pagers (downloadable)

Buttons like:

“Generate a 1-page summary for Product/Data internships”

“Generate a 1-page summary for Engineering internships”
These are generated server-side from structured project data.

5) Tech architecture (React + Node + TypeScript, modern + modular)
Frontend

React + TypeScript

Routing: if you’re using Next.js, do it (best SEO + easiest deployment). If not, React Router is fine but you’ll work harder for SEO.

UI: shadcn/ui + Tailwind (fast, clean, industry-standard)

Motion: Framer Motion for timeline + micro-interactions

Backend (Node.js + TypeScript)

API: NestJS (best for “industry-standard procedures” + structure) or Express + Zod + typed routers

DB: Postgres (projects, artifacts, tags, timeline events)

CMS: use a headless CMS or “MDX content repo”

Best developer workflow: MDX for case studies + a small admin UI later.

AI layer

Embeddings store: pgvector (inside Postgres) or a managed vector DB

RAG: server route that retrieves chunks from your content and responds

Guardrails: only answer from sources; otherwise say “not found”.

Hosting

Frontend: Vercel

Backend: Render/Fly.io

DB: Supabase Postgres (easy, reliable)

6) Information design: how to show “engineering + software + leadership” without chaos

Your site should treat your life like three systems that overlap:

Systems Engineering & Impact

Software/Data Systems

People Systems (leadership, instruction, speaking)

The USDA content is perfect evidence of “people systems”: mentorship roles, structured schedules, safety, program operations 

USDA Program Book

.

7) Content checklist (what you should gather next)

To make this site elite, you need artifacts. Here’s the hit list:

2–3 screenshots per project (before/after if possible)

1 architecture diagram per technical case study

1 short demo video (30–75 seconds) for top 2 projects

Metrics (even small): time saved, users served, event attendance, dashboards shipped, etc.

Speaking: titles, dates, venues, 1 photo if available

Links: GitHub repos, live demos, PDFs (like your program book)

8) A realistic build plan (so it ships fast)

Phase 1 (MVP, 1–2 weeks of focused work)

Home, Work, Case Study pages, About, Contact

3 case studies fully built (Nexusverium, AI Literacy, USDA Program)

Basic timeline

Phase 2 (Polish + authority)

Skill Evidence Graph

Speaking page + media section

SEO pass (OG images, metadata, sitemap)

Phase 3 (AI components)

RAG concierge

“Generate one-pager” feature

Search across projects

9) One key correction to keep the brand consistent

Your PDF says “Aspiring Business Consultant” 

Jensy Jimenez Portfolio

, while your public footprint leans engineering + systems + data .
That’s not “wrong,” but it can confuse recruiters.

Fix: use one umbrella identity:

Systems Builder (Engineering + Data + Software + Leadership)
Then “consulting” becomes the method, not the identity.
